# gradius' screeps code - Typescript Edition!

## TODO
### High level
* Generic actions for screep roles rather than specific named ones (eg: primary_action rather than build)
### Screeps
* More generic parts for screeps so that we can adapt to needs
* More generic roles for screeps so that they don't idle as much
* Repair/Upgrade role modified to fix structures and roads
* Shipping and mining role so we can mine into a container


### Strucutures
#### To Automate
* Towers
* Roads
* Containers
* Storage
