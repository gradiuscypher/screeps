# gradius' screeps code - Typescript Edition!

## Current Work
* container mining
* transport creeps

## Next Up
* dynamic use of containers for building/upgrading/upkeep

## Ideal Pool
* Generic actions for screep roles rather than specific named ones (eg: primary_action rather than build)
* building priorities
* Generic construction actions for finding buildable points around a point
* More generic parts for screeps so that we can adapt to needs
* More generic roles for screeps so that they don't idle as much
* Repair/Upgrade role modified to fix structures and roads
* Shipping and mining role so we can mine into a container
* Implement Towers
* Implement Roads
* Implement storage
* Better repairing logic
* Some sort of resting area for idle creeps so they're not in the way

## Done / Abandoned
* structure upkeep - technically have repairing, but could be better
