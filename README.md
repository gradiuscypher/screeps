# gradius' screeps code - Typescript Edition!

## Current Work
* container mining
* structure upkeep
* transport creeps

## Next Up
* dynamic use of containers for building/upgrading/upkeep

## Ideal Pool
* Generic actions for screep roles rather than specific named ones (eg: primary_action rather than build)
* building priorities
* Generic construction actions for finding buildable points around a point
* More generic parts for screeps so that we can adapt to needs
* More generic roles for screeps so that they don't idle as much
* Repair/Upgrade role modified to fix structures and roads
* Shipping and mining role so we can mine into a container
* Implement Towers
* Implement Roads
* Implement storage
